# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Weather-Journal [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2655/view). Please make sure to re-review the rubric for detailed project requirements prior to submission.
